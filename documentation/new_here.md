# Breaking News! New here? It's ok!

Caveat: This is an evolving project that is seeking to come up with ideas to educate about and to undermine disinformation and habituation and manipulation methods that are happening via such things as the web and newsmedia. Since this project is developing some of the ideas may not be expressed super clearly but hopefully it will get better with time. Adding ideas to this project doesn't mean that you endorse it or any of its sub-ideas.

Events like the Rwanda genocides, wherein psychologically normal people engaged in mass murder of their neighbours, can result from seeds of eugenics ideas and radical radio hosts and inherent problems in human heuristics and tribalism.

We don't want people to be buying into warped theories or disinformation or pushed to far-right and fascist ideologies, or any ideologies that make suffering more likely to happen. Many people today are being manipulated and warped by disinformation and lies and gentle techniques of habituation, and the web can be used to empower these mechanisms through control of flows of information. If you have a friend or know someone that is moving in a direction that appears to be towards odd conspiracies, perhaps featuring theories like [QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) or [The Great Replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Replacement_conspiracy_theory), it is very important that we help them move away from these things.

# Have a friend who is buying in to strange conspiracies or bad news?

Consider showing them the following game developed by the [Drog media literacy project](https://www.disinfo.eu/2019/01/04/fight-disinformation-through-gaming-and-education-the-drog-media-literacy-initiative), which is a team of academics, journalists and media experts headquarted in The Hague. The goal is to educate people on how they can be manipulated by fake profiles, fake news stories etc.:

# Have a friend who is a fascist or being "red-pilled" down that route? Or perhaps you know people that are moderate or centrist and not yet skilled at understanding how fascism is propagated online?

Here are some things to show them:
