# Breaking News! New here?

Caveat: This is an evolving project that is seeking to come up with ideas to educate about and to undermine disinformation propagation, manipulation methods and to mitigate habituation methods that are happening via such things as the web and newsmedia. As this project is developing, some of the ideas may not be expressed clearly but hopefully it will improve. Adding ideas to this project doesn't mean that you endorse it or any of its sub-ideas.

Events like the Rwanda genocides, wherein large numbers of people engaged in mass murder of their neighbours, can result from seeds of eugenics ideas and radical media hosts and inherent problems in human heuristics and tribalism.

Many people today are being manipulated and warped, often unconsciously, by disinformation and lies and gentle techniques of habituation, and are being pushed to racism, far-right and fascist ideologies. The web can be used to amplify these mechanisms through control of flows of information.

Indications that people are being influenced towards fascism and other harmful ideas can include their subscribing to odd conspiracy theories such as [QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon), [The Great Replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Replacement_conspiracy_theory) and [the Straussâ€“Howe generational theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory) (also called the Fourth Turning theory). It is important that we help them move away from these things.
