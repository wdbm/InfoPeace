# Some key actors/players/characters

## Nigel Farage

"Farage sits at the intersection of the key forces in a new world order. An order that the old formats can't cope with. What we need to ask is whether a man closely allied to people like Bannon and supportive of Viktor Orb√°n should be allowed to amplify his propaganda unchallenged on our broadcast media." -- [Carole Cadwalladr, 2018-11-25](https://www.wdbm.pro/1b5b27b6-7f49-4cea-b5e7-aadcb09a5582)
