# So what the hell is fascism anyway?

Well, [as described by Philosophy Tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgwS_FMZ3nQ), common features of fascism are as follows:

- less fond of democracy; more fond of dictatorship
- pro military, pro police
- pro agression, imperialist foreign policy
- pro state; nationalist, xenophobic, tying nationalism to race
- pro toxic masculinity
- pro capitalism, anti communism
- racist, anti-semetic
