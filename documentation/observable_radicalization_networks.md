# Observable radicalization networks

[*Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube*](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DS_Alternative_Influence.pdf) attempts to describe an "Alternative Influence Network" (AIN) consisting of a network featuring vertices that use YouTube to communicate information, and attempts to describe characteristics of the vertices. It attempts to qualify, to some degree, the radicalization capabilities of this network.

A brief summary of some of the basic concepts in the report is provided by The Serfs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HclaKb5LUYY). The Serfs went on to make a comment on Felix Kjellberg/PewDiePie [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Orqtf6WgIs), and the ideas of using plausible deniability and jokes to make what may be neo-fascism harder to detect. It appears that stochastic terrorism has gained power with the web.

- [stochastic terrorism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stochastic_terrorism): "The use of mass public communication, usually against a particular individual or group, which incites or inspires acts of terrorism which are statistically probable but happen seemingly at random."

All of this fits with what the anonymous blogger G2G had to say in his expanded definition of stochastic terrorism: “you heat up the waters and stir the pot, knowing full well that sooner or later a lone wolf will pop up and do the deed. The fact that it will happen is as predictable as the fact that a heated pot of water will eventually boil. But the exact time and place of each incident will remain as random as the appearance of the first bubbles in the boiling pot."

-- Out for Queer Blood, Clayton Delery (2017)

[Spoilers follow.] The 2015 film *Look Who's Back* (*Er Ist Wieder Da*) has the premise that Hitler appears in modern-day Germany and it illustrates the reactions of German people to this spectacle of Hitler interacting with contemporary society. It shows how people start to view him as a humourous or edgy meme but gradually move to think that some of what he says is reasonable.

# 2019-03-15 Brenton Tarrant live streamed gaming-style mass murder of Muslim people at Al Noor Mosque, Christchurch

"I will carry out and attack against the invaders, and will even live stream the attack via facebook... If I don’t survive the attack, goodbye, godbless and I will see you all in Valhalla!" -- Brenton Tarrant

Tarrant posted preparatory links on 8chan. These links were spread via social media networks such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube. Tarrant mentions influencers PewDiePie and Candace Owens and how *Fortnite* "trained [him] to be a killer".

Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons culture committee, said it appeared to be a "terror attack designed for social media" and demonstrated why there had to be "statutory regulation of the distribution of content online through social networks".

He said: "It's a viral contagion spread through social media, helped by their algorithms. The firms need to carry out a major audit into who was sharing this film and how it was shared. Groups have deliberately spread it and those accounts should be closed down."

The number of people murdered corresponds to about 1 in 500 Muslim people in New Zealand.
