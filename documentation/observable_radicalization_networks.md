# Observable radicalization networks

[*Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube*](https://www.wdbm.pro/fb6041c5-a4ae-4b5e-bc3f-71d4bcd68d11) attempts to describe an "Alternative Influence Network" (AIN) consisting of a network featuring vertices that use YouTube to communicate information, and attempts to describe characteristics of the vertices. It attempts to qualify, to some degree, the radicalization capabilities of this network.

A brief summary of some of the basic concepts in the report is provided by The Serfs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HclaKb5LUYY). The Serfs went on to make a comment on Felix Kjellberg/PewDiePie [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Orqtf6WgIs), and the ideas of using plausible deniability and jokes to make what may be neo-fascism harder to detect.

[Spoilers follow.] The 2015 film *Look Who's Back* (*Er Ist Wieder Da*) has the premise that Hitler appears in modern-day Germany and it illustrates the reactions of German people to this spectacle of Hitler interacting with contemporary society. It shows how people start to view him as a humourous or edgy meme but gradually move to think that some of what he says is reasonable.
