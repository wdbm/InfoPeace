# Observable radicalization networks

[*Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube*](https://www.wdbm.pro/fb6041c5-a4ae-4b5e-bc3f-71d4bcd68d11) attempts to describe an "Alternative Influence Network" (AIN) consisting of a network featuring vertices that use YouTube to communicate information, and attempts to describe characteristics of the vertices. It attempts to qualify, to some degree, the radicalization capabilities of this network.

A brief summary of some of the basic concepts in the report is provided by The Serfs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HclaKb5LUYY).
