# Hypothetical strategies

This section details hypothetical strategies that are pure hypothesis or that require further study or that have not been implemented or that are otherwise lacking evidence of effectiveness.

## "The New Green Deal": decreasing wealth inequality by framing responses to climate change as the moral equivalent of war

## deplatforming/node-attenuation and education of people, and deplatforming/node-attenuation of newsmedia

Rights to free expression are extremely important, and yet some progressive voices should be heard more and regressive voices should be heard less. Censorship is a dangerous tool of oppression and should be used with great care if it is necessary, and it is possibly preferable for people to be well-educated in spotting bullshit, however this does not address people with mental illnesses or problems and does not address state-backed hacking of the heuristics of neurotypical people. De-platforming, such as that of Alex Jones on Facebook and Twitter may have reduced that character's influence while also not damaging his fundamental rights to free expression (e.g. he can hold a conversation with his friends but he doesn't get to demand the use of someone's loudspeaker).

## newsmedia direct assessment and meta-analysis assessment

Tools of direct assessment, such as [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org) (charity quality assessments) and [NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com) (journalism quality assessments), are useful, but meta-analysis of the form Ben Goldachre describes in the book *Bad Pharma* are perhaps needed in more detailed analysis. As an example, assessment of a single article from Russian-owned *The Independent* might yield a result of reasonably acceptable journalism and accuracy, yet the bias might be observable only through a meta-analyses of the general output.

## "save a Brexiter victim from neo-fascists" day

Following from the research of [*Mitigating Confirmation Bias on Twitter by Recommending Opposing Views*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03901), arrange a day (perhaps as a large coordinated day) in which arm yourself to the teeth with counterpoints against the known battery of disinformation and misinformation and confront at least one Brexit-believer victim in your life. Try to remember that large numbers of people who voted for Brexit were mislead. Remind them that similar tactics were used to trick people in Nazi Germany and give them ways to change with as much dignity as possible.

## "hack printed copies of rags like The Sun and The Daily Mail" day

Organise a widespread effort that is launched suddenly and then continued to insert printouts into the disinformation rags countering common pro-Brexit disinformation. The [European Commission Euromyths A-Z index](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index) could be a useful source for this, as could disgusting data on Farage [[ref](https://www.scribd.com/doc/169454715/Nigel-Farage-1981-school-letter), [ref](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/25/why-wont-nigel-farage-answer-my-brexit-questions)].

## European Union flag display day as anti-Brexit effort

This is a strategy that might be deployed at some important political or politically-emotive moment.

EU flags can be acquired cheaply in the UK [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0044X2BXI).

At a personal/local level, EU flags can be displayed in windows or on balconies. At a more visible/newsworthy/tourism level, EU flags can be displayed with prominent objects of culture, such as being appended to the traffic cone hat of the Glasgow Nelson Monument or to the status of Greyfriars Bobby somehow. It is important for good photographs to be taken of the results of such a strategy briskly, either personally or by news media that has been contacted beforehand.

## University displays of EU flags

This is a strategy that might be deployed at universities in order both to send a message of acknowledgemwnt of the value of collaborative research across the EU and to EU members of the universities and those besides.

## Neo-fascist milk and "soy boys"

Strength is hypothesized to be valued far over truth in the expression of neo-fascists. In order to undermine their personal sense of strength and their strength as perceived by an audience, attention could be drawn to the near universal experience in mammals of *weaning*, and that milk is evolved to be a high-energy, hormonal liquid best suited to fast growth and protection of babies. Milk is used as a symbol by neo-fascists (presumably because of the color) and consumption of soya products was criticised by Paul Joseph Watson (alt-right, InfoWars) [[ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTSvLKY7HEk)]. Thus, it might be effective (and indeed beneficial ethically and environmentally) to undermine the drinking of milk (and so undermining a neo-fascist symbol and their strength by being likened to a baby) by neo-fascists, perhaps expressing a phrase to the effect of "only babies drink milk".
