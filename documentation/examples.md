# Examples of misinformation and disinformation

## 2019-03-10 New York Times: "The U.S. Blamed Maduro for Burning Aid to Venezuela. New Video Casts Doubt."

Is this misinformation? Is this disinformation? Even if it is not clear, it provides an example of the propagation of inaccurate information that then results in major consequences.

## 2018-07-03 Politicalite: "DUMB LEFTIES ALERT WORLD EXCLUSIVE: The Walter Mitty Behind 'Far Right Watch'"

- <https://www.politicalite.com/exclusive/world-exclusive-walter-mitty-leader-far-right-watch>

The article features the following paragraph, translated here into Markdown:

"*Far Right Watch* targets Brexiteers and patriots on the right systematically. Indeed, even Twitter couldnâ€™t stomach it anymore and have [**recently suspended**](https://twitter.com/account/suspended) the account."

The paragraph links directly to the URL `https://twitter.com/account/suspended`, as opposed to the active Twitter account of John D. P. O'Connell, <https://twitter.com/jdpoc>. However, Far Right Watch [reported](https://www.farrightwatch.net/2018/07/far-right-watch-on-twitter-suspended.html) in 2018-07 on the suspension of its Twitter account <https://twitter.com/Far_Right_Watch>. Is this linking ineptitude or disinformation? Could it be used as a tool of disinformation?
