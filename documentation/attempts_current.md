## European Commission "Euromyths"

- [European Commission Euromyths A-Z index](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index)

This is an archive of "Euromyths" published in UK media that dates from the early 1990s to the present. The archive lists thousands of media reports that are inaccurate or misleading and debunks them all. Some examples:

- The Sun claimed that "nutty" EU officials want to rename "Bombay mix" to "Mumbai mix" in order "to make the snack politically correct". The Euromyths response dismisses this as "completely ludicrous" [[ref](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyth-bombay-mix-to-be-renamed)].
- The Sun claimed that the EU will require women to hand in worn-out sex toys before they can buy new ones [[ref](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/sex-toys-must-be-handed-in)].
- The Daily Express, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror and The Sun all claimed that curved bananas are to be banned [[ref](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/bananas-and-brussels)].
- The Sun that the UK would be forced to switch entirely to metric [[ref](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/off-target-by-a-long-shot)].
- The Independent claimed that a one-size-fits-all "euro condom" is to be rolled out [[ref](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/condom-dimensions-to-be-harmonised)].
