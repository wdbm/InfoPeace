# Primed strategies

This section is designed to be a clear list of evidence-based actions that have been taken or that can be taken  in order to counter disinformation, and this list may feature identifiers for agents tasked with these actions. A proximal target is to stop Brexit disinformation and misinformation, but more generally it is to ensure there are implemented, actional protections against disinformation tactics.

## Quiz-based knowledge barriers to comments sections

There are suggestions that many news media comments sections are a fugazi, made by staffers or machines:

- [*Exclusive - Most of the Daily Mail's 'Commentors' Don't Even Exist*](https://www.farrightwatch.net/2018/09/most-of-daily-mails-commentors-dont.html) -- [John O'Connell](https://twitter.com/jdpoc) (?) (2018-09)

However, many comments are by humans. One approach is to enforce a knowledge quiz before empowering the ability of a human to comment. For instance, the Norwegian news site NRKbeta requires commenters to display a basic understanding of an article before they can use the platform to make a comment on the article. The goal is to discourage uninformed "rant modes" and to foster more productive, positive and educated conversations among readers.
