# Introduction and some broad ideas

## Quick intro ideas

In [October 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/10/how-deal-fake-feminism-pour-cold-water-lap-russia) a video circulated proporting to illustrate a woman pouring diluted bleach on the groins of men "manspreading" on the St. Petersburg subway. The media responded in a self-replicating manner with titles of the form "Has she gone too far?". This provoked anti-feminist and pro-feminist responses. It was said later by St. Petersburg magazine *Bumuga* to have been a hoax, one of the "manspreaders" apparently open about being a paid actor, and that the hoax was a state-orchestrated hoax. Quite aside from the dubious theory of "manspreading" in the first place, we suggest that the release of the knowledge that this is a hoax was intentional.

We propose that this hoax is a very minor example of disinformation tactics in use and we wish to explore ways to observe such disinformation and how to mitigate it, including consideration of counter-disinformation methods. Understanding this can involve mixing ideas about constraints and failure modes of heuristics in human brains, human networks and other information networks, ideas about game theory, and ideas about disinformation, misinformation, counter-information and propaganda.

The Adam Curtis documentary [*HyperNormalisation*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz6u7xRznjY) offers a historical narrative of the thinking and the people behind these kinds of disinformation campaigns. A current historical picture of the structure of disinformation campaigns is offered by Robert Evans with the *Bellingcat* article [*From Memes to Infowars: How 75 Fascist Activists Were "Red-Pilled"*](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled).
