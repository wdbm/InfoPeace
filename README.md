*"Truth", it has been said, "is the first casualty of war."* -- Philip Snowden, 1916

The beginnings of a collection of ideas for societal-level defences against active disinformation campaigns and strategies or: How I learned to stop worrying and start a collaborative repository to try to address mind-hacking and consider development of Kōans for neo-fascists

This is an evolving project, so feel free to add comments or ideas or material or remove material or whatnot. I guess just try to keep the Markdown pretty neat is all and for now just commit directly to the master branch.

# Some broad ideas

## Quick intro ideas

In [October 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/10/how-deal-fake-feminism-pour-cold-water-lap-russia) a video circulated proporting to illustrate a woman pouring diluted bleach on the groins of men manspreading on the St. Petersburg subway. The media responded predictably in a self-replicating manner with titles of the form "Has she gone too far?". This provoked anti-feminist and pro-feminist responses. It was said later by St. Petersburg magazine *Bumuga* to have been a hoax, one of the manspreaders apparently open about being a paid actor, and that the hoax was a state-orchestrated hoax. We suggest that the release of the knowledge that this is a hoax was intentional.

We propose that this hoax, a very minor but clear example, is part of a global disinformation campaign and we wish to explore ways to observe such disinformation and how to combat it, including consideration of counter-disinformation methods.

The Adam Curtis documentary [*HyperNormalisation*](https://www.wdbm.pro/23959c86-4a06-4d6e-ab02-d99f02348740) offers a historical narrative of the thinking and the people behind these kinds of disinformation campaigns. If you want to start somewhere, viewing that documentary is a good place. A current historical picture of the disinformation campaign is offered by the Eobert Evans of *Bellingcat* article [*From Memes to Infowars: How 75 Fascist Activists Were "Red-Pilled"*](https://www.wdbm.pro/09dc76fe-bcd6-4cd5-81d9-f47d30734da3).

The name of this project *InfoPeace* is in counter-reference to the effort called *InfoWars* which was founded by Alex Jones.

## Observable radicalization networks

[*Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube*](https://www.wdbm.pro/fb6041c5-a4ae-4b5e-bc3f-71d4bcd68d11) attempts to describe an "Alternative Influence Network" (AIN) consisting of a network featuring vertices that use YouTube to communicate information, and attempts to describe characteristics of the vertices. It attempts to qualify, to some degree, the radicalization capabilities of this network.

## Generalized Network Dismantling

[*Generalized Network Dismantling*](https://www.wdbm.pro/6332ea7e-18aa-4f5d-9f6c-5203654296a2) suggests ideas that disrupt information networks. While the current generations of [adversarial examples](https://www.wdbm.pro/52dd98ab-161b-4879-91b4-5f8981832540) in the context of machine learning might not be applicable to individual humans, might they be applicable to networks of humans? How would generalized network dismantling techniques in social media be implemented, observed or even combated?

There are many tools available in this context ranging from ethical to unethical. One class of tool is counter-disinformation. Another class of tool is deplatforming/vertex attenuation.

### Scale-free networks

The degree of a vertex in a graph or network is the number of connections it has to other vertices, and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network. A scale-free network is a network that has a degree distribution that follows a power law, at least asymptotically. Examples of scale-free networks might be the scientific paper citation network, or the [webgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webgraph) of the World Wide Web, or social networks.

Scale-free networks are more robust to random attacks than random network structures but are *more vulnerable* to targeted attacks. Finding the set of influential vertices (the minimal set of vertices the removal of which results in the network fragmented into subnetworks of subcritical size) is called the network dismantling problem. It is an NP-hard problem. The paper [*Generalized Network Dismantling*](https://www.wdbm.pro/6332ea7e-18aa-4f5d-9f6c-5203654296a2) attempts to address the question of how to select the set of vertices which, when removed/deactivated/attenuated can stop the spread of (dis)information. The paper posits the idea of the cost of removing a vertex, a non-negative real number, which might be defined by a function of vertex centrality characteristics, such as degree, page-rank, betweenness or other characteristics not suitable for description in a simple graph object.

## Activation maximization

Could [activation maximization](https://www.wdbm.pro/f2b7c104-4254-48f9-bb7d-0d9a26084f8e) provide hints at what social network patterns correspond to resonating with the limbic systems of the vertices of [self-isolating groups](https://www.wdbm.pro/52e4ebd8-34ff-4d1b-aae1-17b974fcb62c)?

# IPUUID4

This is a simple general reference format that can be generated in the following way, perhaps as a `.bashrc` function:

```Python
ipuuid4(){python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"}
```

Such identifier codes could be used with a link-shortening service like [ovipositor](https://www.wdbm.pro/ovipositor).
